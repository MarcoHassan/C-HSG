## Client-Server Socket connession and Simple - imperfect - Chatbot

This is the final project for the Programming with Advanced Languages contextual course of the University of St. Gallen. For the course
I decided to implement a simple Client-Sever Socket connession and develop on it a simple chatbot.

Based on it two versions were developed. On the one hand I implemented a simple one threaded Chatbot where one client at the time
can connect to the server. On the other hand I developed on the freely available multithreaded code available at [MultiClient Chat](https://github.com/rbaron/multichat).

The code for the such connession is saved in the basics repository. To experiment the system you simply have to compile both the
client.cpp and the server.cpp files.
